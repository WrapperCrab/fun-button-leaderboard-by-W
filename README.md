# Fun Button Leaderboard by W
## A Communal Competetive Click Counter Leaderboard

See this plugin in action on my website at https://www.mowinpeople.com/the-button/

This is a WordPress plugin that displays a leaderboard for the top clickers in my other plugin fun-button-by-W on my GitHub at https://github.com/WrapperCrab/fun-button-by-W/

### How to Use
This plugin uses shortcodes:

You create the leaderboard with the shortcode `[fun-button-leaderboard]`

This plugin only works if the Fun Button plugin is active.
It cycles through all users' number of clicks in the database, saving and displaying the top 5 usernames along with their number of clicks.

The Leaderboard updates every 5 seconds.
